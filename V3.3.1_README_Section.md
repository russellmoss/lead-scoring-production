## V3.3.1: Portable Book Signal Exclusions (December 2025)

### Background & Motivation

In December 2025, we conducted a comprehensive hypothesis validation analysis to test four signals that might indicate advisors with **portable books of business**:

| Hypothesis | Theory | Data Source |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Solo-Practitioner Proxy | Advisors at firms with 1-3 reps OWN the book entirely | `firm_rep_count` calculated from FinTrx |
| Discretionary AUM Ratio | >80% discretionary = trust-based, portable relationships | `ria_firms_current.DISCRETIONARY_AUM / TOTAL_AUM` |
| Portable Custodian | Schwab/Fidelity/Pershing = easier transitions | `ria_firms_current.CUSTODIAN_PRIMARY_BUSINESS_NAME` |
| Rainmaker vs Servicer | Founders/Partners own books; Associates don't | `ria_contacts_current.TITLE_NAME` pattern matching |

### 🔄 Key Finding: Invert Your Thinking

**These signals work better as EXCLUSION criteria than INCLUSION criteria.**

Our existing tier system (CFP + Bleeding Firm, Series 65 Only, HV Wealth Titles) already captures positive signals effectively. The portable book analysis revealed **strong NEGATIVE signals** that help filter out low-converting leads.

### ✅ Validated Signals (Implemented)

| Signal | Conversion Rate | Lift vs Baseline | Action | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| **Low Discretionary (<50%)** | 1.32% | **0.34x** | **EXCLUDE** | ~5,800 leads removed |
| **Large Firm (>50 reps)** | 2.31% | **0.60x** | **V4 DEPRIORITIZE** | Flag for ML |
| **Servicer Titles** | 1.91% | **0.50x** | **EXCLUDE** | Already implemented |
| Moderate Discretionary (50-80%) | 1.48% | 0.39x | Monitor | Future consideration |

### ❌ Signals NOT Added (Invalidated by Data)

| Signal | Conversion Rate | Lift | Why NOT Added |
|--------|-----------------|------|---------------|
| **Solo Practitioner (1-3 reps)** | 3.75% | 0.98x | Not significantly better than 3.82% baseline |
| **Rainmaker Titles** | 2.23% | **0.58x** | Actually **WORSE** than regular producers! |
| **Portable Custodian** | N/A | N/A | Data quality issue - 0 matches found |

### 🤔 Why Rainmakers Convert Worse (Counterintuitive but Logical)

The hypothesis that Founders/Principals/Partners would convert better was intuitive but **wrong**:

1. **Already successful** - They've built their ideal practice; why change?
2. **Equity-locked** - Partnership agreements create golden handcuffs
3. **Succession mindset** - Planning exit, not growth
4. **Our sweet spot is mid-career** - Ambitious producers building toward ownership

**This validates our existing model's focus on mobility + bleeding firms over seniority/ownership titles.**

### 📊 Discretionary AUM Data Quality

The discretionary signal comes from **Form ADV** regulatory filings:

| Discretionary Bucket | Firm Count | Avg AUM | % of Firms |
|---------------------|------------|---------|------------|
| 95%+ Discretionary | 21,366 | $5.4B | 47% |
| 80-95% Discretionary | 2,370 | $4.5B | 5% |
| 50-80% Discretionary | 1,364 | $7.7B | 3% |
| <50% Discretionary | 1,159 | $7.4B | 3% |
| 0% Discretionary | 1,972 | $500M | 4% |
| No AUM Data | 17,002 | N/A | 38% |

**Key Insight:** Low discretionary firms are NOT small firms - they're large ($7.4B avg AUM) but have a fundamentally different business model (transaction-based, not relationship-based). The 0.34x lift isn't because they're small; it's because their client relationships aren't portable.

### 🔧 Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
```
v3/sql/phase_4_v3_tiered_scoring.sql     # Added firm_discretionary CTE + exclusion filter
pipeline/sql/January_2026_Lead_List_V3_V4_Hybrid.sql  # Added discretionary filter
pipeline/sql/v4_prospect_features.sql    # Added is_large_firm feature
v3/models/model_registry_v3.json         # Updated to V3.3.1
```

**SQL Exclusion Filter:**
```sql
-- Exclude low discretionary firms (0.34x baseline)
-- Allow NULL/Unknown - don't penalize missing data
AND (
    discretionary_ratio >= 0.50 
    OR discretionary_ratio IS NULL
)
```

**New V4 Feature:**
```sql
-- Large firm flag for deprioritization
CASE WHEN firm_rep_count_at_contact > 50 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_large_firm
```

### 📈 Expected Impact

| Metric | Before V3.3.1 | After V3.3.1 | Change |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Total Lead Pool | ~35,000 | ~29,200 | -17% |
| Excluded Lead Conv Rate | - | 1.32% | - |
| Remaining Pool Conv Rate | 3.82% | ~4.1% (est) | **+7%** |
| High-Tier Overlap | - | <5% | ✅ Safe |

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

Based on the analysis, consider these future improvements:

1. **Investigate Custodian Data** - Run diagnostic queries to understand actual field values
2. **Test Moderate Discretionary Exclusion** - Consider excluding 50-80% range (0.39x lift)
3. **Add Discretionary to V4 Model** - Include as continuous feature for ML optimization
4. **Monitor Exclusion Impact** - Track actual conversion rates post-implementation
