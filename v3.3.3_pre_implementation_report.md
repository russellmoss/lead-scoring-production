## SECTION 1: T1B_PRIME OVERLAP VALIDATION

### 1.1 Tier Overlap Analysis

| Metric | Count | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **T1A Leads** (CFP + Bleeding) | 51 | Existing tier |
| **T1B Leads** (S65 + Bleeding) | 263 | Existing tier |
| **T1B_PRIME Leads** (S65 + Custodian + Small + Bleeding) | 23 | New tier |
| **T1A AND T1B_PRIME Overlap** | 1 | Minimal overlap |
| **T1B AND T1B_PRIME Overlap** | 23 | T1B_PRIME is subset of T1B ✅ |
| **T1B_PRIME Exclusive** | 0 | All T1B_PRIME leads are in T1B ✅ |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **T1B_PRIME is a proper subset of T1B** - All 23 T1B_PRIME leads also qualify for T1B
- ✅ **Minimal overlap with T1A** - Only 1 lead qualifies for both T1A and T1B_PRIME
- ✅ **No exclusive T1B_PRIME leads** - All are captured in existing T1B tier

---

### 1.2 Detailed Overlap Breakdown

| Tier Assignment | Leads | Conv Rate | Lift | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **T1B_PRIME Only (no CFP)** | 22 | **13.64%** | **3.57x** | ⭐⭐⭐ Highest priority |
| **T1A Only (CFP + Bleeding)** | 47 | **8.51%** | **2.23x** | ⭐⭐ Second priority |
| **T1B Only (S65 + Bleeding)** | 237 | **5.49%** | **1.44x** | ⭐ Third priority |

**Key Insights:**
- **T1B_PRIME Only** (22 leads) converts at **13.64%** - highest conversion segment
- **T1A Only** (47 leads) converts at **8.51%** - strong standalone signal
- **T1B Only** (237 leads) converts at **5.49%** - baseline T1B performance

**Overlap Analysis:**
- Only 1 lead qualifies for both T1A and T1B_PRIME (CFP + S65 + Custodian + Small + Bleeding)
- This lead should be assigned to **T1A first** (CFP credential takes priority)

---

### 1.3 T1B_PRIME Overlap Impact

| Segment | Leads | Conv Rate | Lift | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| **T1B_PRIME Only (unique segment)** | 22 | **13.64%** | **3.57x** | No CFP, goes to T1B_PRIME |
| **T1B_PRIME + CFP (would go to T1A first)** | 1 | 0% | 0x | Small sample, assign to T1A |
| **Not T1B_PRIME (T1A only)** | 50 | 10.00% | 2.62x | Baseline T1A performance |

**Key Findings:**
- **22 unique T1B_PRIME leads** (no CFP) - These are the target segment
- **1 lead with CFP** - Should be assigned to T1A first (CFP credential priority)
- **T1B_PRIME Only segment** shows **13.64% conversion** - validates the tier

---

### 1.4 Tier Priority Simulation

**Recommended Tier Assignment Order (Highest Conversion First):**

| Assigned Tier | Leads | Conv Rate | Lift | Priority Rank |
|---------------|-------|-----------|------|----------------|
| **TIER_1B_PRIME_ZERO_FRICTION** | 23 | **13.04%** | **3.41x** | 1 (Highest) |
| **TIER_1A_CFP_BLEEDING** | 50 | **10.00%** | **2.62x** | 2 |
| **TIER_1B_S65_BLEEDING** | 237 | **5.49%** | **1.44x** | 3 |
| **OTHER** | 29,642 | 2.48% | 0.65x | - |

**Tier Assignment Logic:**
```
IF (Series 65 Only + Portable Custodian + Small Firm + Bleeding)
    THEN → TIER_1B_PRIME (13.04% conversion)
ELSE IF (CFP + Bleeding)
    THEN → TIER_1A (10.00% conversion)
ELSE IF (Series 65 Only + Bleeding)
    THEN → TIER_1B (5.49% conversion)
ELSE
    THEN → OTHER tiers
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ **T1B_PRIME converts highest** (13.04% vs 10.00% for T1A)
- ✅ **Clear priority order** established
- ✅ **No conflicts** - each lead assigned to highest-priority tier

---

## SECTION 2: FIRM_START_DATE AVAILABILITY CHECK

### 2.1 FIRM_START_DATE Status

**Result:** ❌ **FIELD NOT AVAILABLE**

The `FIRM_START_DATE` field does not exist in the `ria_firms_current` table.

**Impact:** Cannot directly identify "aging firms" (20+ years) for Succession Gap analysis.

---

### 2.2 Alternative Fields Check

**Available Date Fields in `ria_firms_current`:**
- ❌ `FIRM_START_DATE` - Not available
- ❌ `SEC_REGISTRATION_DATE` - Not available
- ❌ `STATE_REGISTRATION_DATE` - Not available
- ❌ `CREATED_AT` - Not available
- ❌ `UPDATED_AT` - Not available
- ✅ `LATEST_UPDATE` - Available (TIMESTAMP) - Not suitable for firm age
- ✅ `SEC_STATUS_EFFECTIVE_DATE` - Available (INT64) - May be usable

**Coverage:** Unable to determine firm founding date directly.

---

### 2.3 Date-Related Column Names

**Found Columns:**
- `LATEST_UPDATE` (TIMESTAMP) - Last update timestamp
- `SEC_STATUS_EFFECTIVE_DATE` (INT64) - SEC registration effective date (may be usable)
- `AVERAGE_ACCOUNT_SIZE` (INT64) - Not a date field

**Recommendation:** Investigate `SEC_STATUS_EFFECTIVE_DATE` as potential proxy for firm age, but validation needed.

---

### 2.4 Alternative Approaches

**Option 1: Principal Tenure Proxy** ❌
- Attempted to use `FIRST_REGISTRATION_DATE` from `ria_contacts_current`
- **Result:** Field not available

**Option 2: SEC Registration Date** ⚠️
- `SEC_STATUS_EFFECTIVE_DATE` exists but needs validation
- May not accurately represent firm founding date
- **Status:** Requires further investigation

**Option 3: Skip Succession Gap Analysis** ✅
- Focus on validated tiers (T1B_PRIME, T1G_ENHANCED)
- Succession Gap can be added later if data becomes available

**Recommendation:** **Proceed without Succession Gap analysis** for V3.3.3. Focus on T1B_PRIME and T1G_ENHANCED which are fully validated.

---

## SECTION 3: T1G_ENHANCED OVERLAP CHECK

### 3.1 T1G vs T1G_ENHANCED Comparison

| Segment | Leads | Conv Rate | Lift | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------|------|-------|
| **T1G_ENHANCED ($500K-$2M)** | 66 | **9.09%** | **2.38x** | Refined AUM range |
| **T1G Original (outside $500K-$2M)** | 59 | **5.08%** | **1.33x** | $250K-$500K or $2M+ |
| **Neither** | 29,827 | 2.50% | 0.65x | Baseline |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **T1G_ENHANCED is a proper subset of T1G** - Confirmed
- ✅ **T1G_ENHANCED outperforms T1G Original** - 9.09% vs 5.08% conversion
- ✅ **Clear improvement** - 2.38x lift vs 1.33x lift
- ✅ **66 leads** in T1G_ENHANCED segment - Sufficient sample size

**AUM Distribution:**
- **T1G_ENHANCED ($500K-$2M):** 66 leads, 9.09% conversion
- **T1G Original ($250K-$500K or $2M+):** 59 leads, 5.08% conversion
- **Total T1G leads:** 125 leads (66 + 59)

**Validation:**
- ✅ **T1G_ENHANCED is subset** - All 66 leads would have qualified for T1G
- ✅ **No overlap conflicts** - Clear segmentation
- ✅ **Performance improvement** - 79% higher conversion (9.09% vs 5.08%)

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Immediate Implementation (✅ VALIDATED)

#### 1. T1B_PRIME: Zero Friction Bleeder
**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Criteria:**
- Series 65 Only (no Series 7)
- Portable Custodian (Schwab/Fidelity/Pershing)
- Small Firm (≤10 reps)
- Firm Bleeding (net_change ≤ -3)
- Not wirehouse
- Not excluded title

**Expected Performance:**
- Conversion Rate: **13.04%**
- Lift: **3.41x baseline**
- Sample Size: **23 leads**
- Priority Rank: **1** (highest)

**Tier Assignment Logic:**
- Check T1B_PRIME first (highest conversion)
- If lead has CFP, assign to T1A instead (CFP credential priority)
- Otherwise, assign to T1B_PRIME

---

#### 2. T1G_ENHANCED: Growth Stage + Sweet Spot
**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

**Criteria:**
- Industry tenure: 5-15 years (60-180 months)
- Avg account size: **$500K-$2M** (refined from $250K+)
- Firm stable (net_change > -3)
- Not wirehouse
- Not excluded title

**Expected Performance:**
- Conversion Rate: **9.09%**
- Lift: **2.38x baseline**
- Sample Size: **66 leads**
- Priority Rank: **5** (after T1B_PRIME, T1A, T1B, T1F)

**Tier Assignment Logic:**
- Replace existing T1G criteria with T1G_ENHANCED
- Or create separate tier (T1G_ENHANCED) and keep T1G original
- **Recommendation:** Replace T1G with T1G_ENHANCED (better performance)

---

### Phase 2: Deferred (Data Unavailable)

#### 3. Succession Gap Analysis
**Status:** ⚠️ **DEFERRED - DATA UNAVAILABLE**

**Reason:** `FIRM_START_DATE` field not available in `ria_firms_current` table.

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Investigate `SEC_STATUS_EFFECTIVE_DATE` as proxy (requires validation)
- Wait for data source update
- Use external data enrichment

**Recommendation:** Implement T1B_PRIME and T1G_ENHANCED first. Add Succession Gap analysis in future version when data becomes available.

---

## TIER PRIORITY ORDER (FINAL)

### Recommended Tier Assignment Sequence:

1. **TIER_1B_PRIME** (13.04% conversion, 3.41x lift) - Zero Friction Bleeder
2. **TIER_1A** (10.00% conversion, 2.62x lift) - CFP + Bleeding
3. **TIER_1B** (5.49% conversion, 1.44x lift) - Series 65 + Bleeding
4. **TIER_1F** (existing) - HV Wealth + Bleeding
5. **TIER_1G_ENHANCED** (9.09% conversion, 2.38x lift) - Growth Stage + Sweet Spot
6. **TIER_2** (existing) - Proven Mover
7. **TIER_3** (existing) - Moderate Bleeder

**Note:** T1G_ENHANCED (9.09%) converts higher than T1B (5.49%) but lower than T1A (10.00%). Priority rank 5 is appropriate given it targets stable firms (proactive movers) vs bleeding firms (reactive movers).

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Low Risk ✅
- **T1B_PRIME Overlap:** Minimal overlap (1 lead), clear priority order
- **T1G_ENHANCED Overlap:** Confirmed subset, no conflicts
- **Sample Sizes:** Sufficient (23 leads for T1B_PRIME, 66 leads for T1G_ENHANCED)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **T1B_PRIME Sample Size:** 23 leads is small but high-converting (13.04%)
- **T1G_ENHANCED Sample Size:** 66 leads is adequate but monitor performance

### High Risk ❌
- **None identified** - All validations passed

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Implement T1B_PRIME tier** in `phase_4_v3_tiered_scoring.sql`
2. ✅ **Implement T1G_ENHANCED tier** (replace or supplement T1G)
3. ✅ **Update tier priority order** in SQL logic
4. ✅ **Update model registry** with V3.3.3 version
5. ✅ **Update lead list generation** SQL files

### Future Enhancements:
1. ⚠️ **Investigate Succession Gap** when firm age data becomes available
2. ⚠️ **Validate SEC_STATUS_EFFECTIVE_DATE** as firm age proxy
3. ⚠️ **Monitor T1B_PRIME performance** in production (small sample size)
