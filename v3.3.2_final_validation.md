# V3.3.2 Final Validation Report

**Date:** December 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Final validation checks before implementing T1G Growth Stage Advisor tier  
**Baseline Conversion Rate:** 3.82%

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Findings

1. **✅ T1G Has ZERO Overlap with Existing Tiers**
   - T1G (Growth Stage) = 125 leads, 7.20% conversion (1.88x lift)
   - T1B (Series65) = 263 leads, 6.46% conversion (1.69x lift)
   - **No overlap** - T1G requires stable firm, T1A/T1B require bleeding firm
   - **Recommendation:** ✅ **SAFE TO IMPLEMENT** - Adds new value without cannibalizing existing tiers

2. **🚀 SUPER TIER DISCOVERED: T1H (Certification + Growth Stage)**
   - **Has Certification + Growth Stage:** 35 leads, **8.57% conversion (2.24x lift)**
   - **No Certification + Growth Stage:** 90 leads, 6.67% conversion (1.75x lift)
   - **Recommendation:** ⚠️ **CONSIDER FOR V4** - Sample size too small (35 leads) for V3.3.2

3. **📍 Geographic Analysis: Not Actionable**
   - Top states show lift (AR: 2.57x, MD: 2.11x, KS: 1.58x)
   - Sample sizes too small (51-464 leads per state)
   - **Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** - Geographic targeting not viable

## 1. HIGH PRIORITY: Tier Overlap Analysis

### Question
Does T1G (Growth Stage Advisor) overlap with existing tiers T1A, T1B, or T1F? If so, we're not adding new value.

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Criteria | Firm Stability |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **T1A** | CFP + Bleeding Firm | Bleeding (net_change <= -3) |
| **T1B** | Series 65 Only + Bleeding Firm | Bleeding (net_change <= -3) |
| **T1F** | HV Wealth Title + Bleeding Firm | Bleeding (net_change <= -3) |
| **T1G** | Mid-Career (5-15yr) + Established ($250K+ avg) + **Stable Firm** | **Stable (net_change > -3)** |

**Key Difference:** T1G requires a **STABLE** firm, while T1A/T1B/T1F require a **BLEEDING** firm. This is mutually exclusive!

### Results

| Tier Assignment | Leads | Conversions | Conv Rate | Lift |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **T1G (Growth Stage)** | **125** | **9** | **7.20%** | **1.88x** ⭐ |
| T1B (Series65) | 263 | 17 | 6.46% | 1.69x |
| T1F (HV Wealth) | 254 | 13 | 5.12% | 1.34x |
| Other | 29,564 | 729 | 2.47% | 0.65x |

### Overlap Analysis

**T1G Overlap Check:**
- **T1G Only (no overlap):** 125 leads, 7.20% conversion ✅
- **T1G + T1A Overlap:** 0 leads (mutually exclusive - different firm stability requirements)
- **T1G + T1B Overlap:** 0 leads (mutually exclusive - different firm stability requirements)

**T1A Check:**
- **T1A (CFP + Bleeding):** 0 leads in dataset
- **Note:** This suggests CFP advisors at bleeding firms are rare or already excluded

### Key Insights

1. **✅ ZERO OVERLAP:** T1G is completely separate from existing tiers
   - T1G targets **stable firms** (net_change > -3)
   - T1A/T1B/T1F target **bleeding firms** (net_change <= -3)
   - These are **mutually exclusive** criteria

2. **T1G Adds New Value:**
   - Captures 125 leads that would NOT be in T1A/T1B/T1F
   - 7.20% conversion rate (1.88x lift) - highest of all tiers
   - **No cannibalization** of existing tier performance

3. **T1A Has Zero Leads:**
   - CFP + Bleeding Firm = 0 leads in dataset
   - May be due to exclusions or data quality
   - Not a concern for T1G implementation

### Recommendation

✅ **SAFE TO IMPLEMENT T1G**
- Zero overlap with existing tiers
- Adds 125 new high-converting leads
- 7.20% conversion (1.88x lift) - best performing tier
- No risk of cannibalizing existing tier performance

---

## 2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Certification + Growth Stage Interaction

### Question
Does adding CFP/Series 65 certification to the Growth Stage criteria create a "super-tier" with even higher conversion?

### Hypothesis
CFP/Series 65 + Growth Stage = T1H super-tier with 10%+ conversion

### Results

| Certification Status | Growth Stage Status | Leads | Conversions | Conv Rate | Lift |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Has Certification** | **Meets Growth Stage** | **35** | **3** | **8.57%** | **2.24x** 🚀 |
| No Certification | Meets Growth Stage | 90 | 6 | 6.67% | 1.75x |
| Has Certification | Does Not Meet | 5,071 | 188 | 3.71% | 0.97x |
| No Certification | Does Not Meet | 24,756 | 558 | 2.25% | 0.59x |

### Key Findings

1. **🚀 SUPER TIER DISCOVERED:**
   - **Certification + Growth Stage = 8.57% conversion (2.24x lift)**
   - This is **HIGHER** than T1G alone (7.20%)
   - **19% improvement** over T1G baseline

2. **Sample Size Concern:**
   - Only **35 leads** in this segment
   - Below minimum threshold of 50 leads for tier creation
   - **Statistical significance:** Margin of error = ±10.3% (95% CI: -1.7% to 18.8%)

3. **Growth Stage Still Strong Without Certification:**
   - No Certification + Growth Stage = 6.67% (1.75x lift)
   - Still above 1.5x threshold
   - 90 leads (acceptable sample size)

### Recommendation

⚠️ **CONSIDER FOR V4, NOT V3.3.2**

**Option 1: Implement T1G Only (Recommended for V3.3.2)**
- 125 leads, 7.20% conversion (1.88x lift)
- Sufficient sample size
- Validated and ready to implement

**Option 2: Create T1H Super-Tier (V4 Consideration)**
- 35 leads, 8.57% conversion (2.24x lift)
- Sample size too small for V3.3.2
- **Potential Definition:**
  ```sql
  WHEN (has_cfp = 1 OR has_series_65_only = 1)
       AND industry_tenure_months BETWEEN 60 AND 180
       AND avg_account_size >= 250000
       AND firm_net_change_12mo > -3
  THEN 'TIER_1H_CERTIFIED_GROWTH_STAGE'
  ```
- **Expected Performance:** 8.57% conversion (2.24x lift)
- **Priority:** Monitor in V4 - if sample size grows, consider implementation

**Option 3: Two-Tier Approach (V4)**
- **T1G:** Growth Stage (no certification requirement) = 90 leads, 6.67%
- **T1H:** Certified Growth Stage = 35 leads, 8.57%
- **Total:** 125 leads, weighted average 7.20%

## 3. LOW PRIORITY: Geographic Analysis

### Question
Are there geographic patterns in conversion rates that we should consider for tiering?

### Results (Top 20 States by Conversion Rate)

| State | Leads | Conversions | Conv Rate | Lift |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **AR (Arkansas)** | **51** | **5** | **9.80%** | **2.57x** |
| **MD (Maryland)** | **161** | **13** | **8.07%** | **2.11x** |
| **KS (Kansas)** | **464** | **28** | **6.03%** | **1.58x** |

| LA (Louisiana) | 81 | 3 | 3.70% | 0.97x |
| OH (Ohio) | 550 | 20 | 3.64% | 0.95x |
| IL (Illinois) | 842 | 30 | 3.56% | 0.93x |
| CA (California) | 1,607 | 53 | 3.30% | 0.86x |
| UT (Utah) | 123 | 4 | 3.25% | 0.85x |
| NC (North Carolina) | 351 | 11 | 3.13% | 0.82x |
| VA (Virginia) | 228 | 7 | 3.07% | 0.80x |
| AZ (Arizona) | 696 | 20 | 2.87% | 0.75x |
| IA (Iowa) | 768 | 22 | 2.86% | 0.75x |
| GA (Georgia) | 490 | 14 | 2.86% | 0.75x |

### Key Findings

1. **Top 3 States Show Lift:**
   - **Arkansas:** 9.80% (2.57x) - 51 leads
   - **Maryland:** 8.07% (2.11x) - 161 leads
   - **Kansas:** 6.03% (1.58x) - 464 leads

2. **Sample Size Issues:**
   - Top 2 states (AR, MD) have <200 leads each
   - **Arkansas:** 51 leads (too small for tier creation)
   - **Maryland:** 161 leads (borderline)
   - **Kansas:** 464 leads (acceptable, but only 1.58x lift)

3. **Large States Underperform:**
   - **California:** 1,607 leads, 3.30% (0.86x) - BELOW baseline
   - **Texas:** 983 leads, 3.76% (0.99x) - AT baseline
   - **Illinois:** 842 leads, 3.56% (0.93x) - BELOW baseline

4. **No Clear Geographic Pattern:**
   - High-converting states are scattered (AR, MD, KS)
   - No regional clustering
   - Likely due to other factors (firm characteristics, advisor profiles) rather than geography

### Recommendation

❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT GEOGRAPHIC TIERING**

**Reasons:**
1. **Sample Size Too Small:** Top states have <200 leads each
2. **No Clear Pattern:** High-converting states are geographically scattered
3. **Large States Underperform:** CA, TX, IL are at or below baseline
4. **Likely Confounding Factors:** Geographic differences likely due to firm/advisor characteristics, not geography itself

**Alternative Use Case:**
- Geographic data may be useful for **sales territory optimization** (not tiering)
- Consider geographic analysis for **resource allocation** (where to focus sales efforts)
- **Not recommended** for lead scoring tier creation

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 4.1 For V3.3.2: Implement T1G (Growth Stage Advisor)

**✅ RECOMMENDED: Implement T1G Tier**

**Tier Definition:**
```sql
-- TIER_1G: Growth Stage Advisor
WHEN industry_tenure_months BETWEEN 60 AND 180  -- 5-15 years (mid-career)
     AND avg_account_size >= 250000              -- Established practice ($250K+ avg)
     AND firm_net_change_12mo > -3                -- Stable/Growing firm (not bleeding)
THEN 'TIER_1G_GROWTH_STAGE_ADVISOR'
```

**Expected Performance:**
- **Leads:** 125
- **Conversion Rate:** 7.20%
- **Lift:** 1.88x baseline
- **Sample Size:** ✅ Validated (125 leads)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Zero overlap with existing tiers
- ✅ Highest conversion rate of all tiers (7.20%)
- ✅ Sufficient sample size (125 leads)
- ✅ Meets 1.5x lift threshold
- ✅ Adds new value without cannibalizing existing tiers

### 4.2 For V4: Consider T1H (Certified Growth Stage)

**⚠️ CONSIDER FOR V4: T1H Super-Tier**

**Tier Definition:**
```sql
-- TIER_1H: Certified Growth Stage Advisor
WHEN (has_cfp = 1 OR has_series_65_only = 1)   -- Has certification
     AND industry_tenure_months BETWEEN 60 AND 180  -- 5-15 years
     AND avg_account_size >= 250000              -- Established practice
     AND firm_net_change_12mo > -3                -- Stable firm
THEN 'TIER_1H_CERTIFIED_GROWTH_STAGE'
```

**Expected Performance:**
- **Leads:** 35 (current)
- **Conversion Rate:** 8.57%
- **Lift:** 2.24x baseline
- **Sample Size:** ⚠️ Too small for V3.3.2 (35 leads)

**Recommendation:**
- **Monitor in V4:** Track if sample size grows to 50+ leads
- **If sample size grows:** Consider implementing as T1H
- **Alternative:** Keep as T1G but prioritize certified advisors within T1G

### 4.3 Do Not Implement: Geographic Tiering

**❌ NOT RECOMMENDED: Geographic Tiering**

**Reasons:**
- Sample sizes too small (<200 leads per state)
- No clear geographic pattern
- Large states underperform (CA, TX, IL)
- Likely confounding factors (not geography itself)
