## V3.3.2: Growth Stage Advisor Tier (January 2026)

### Background & Discovery

Following V3.3.1, we tested additional "portable book" hypotheses. While most individual signals were invalidated (ownership, HNW focus, SMA usage), we discovered a powerful new segment through combination analysis:

**"Proactive Movers"** - Advisors at STABLE firms who are seeking a platform upgrade.

This is fundamentally different from our existing bleeding-firm tiers (T1A, T1B, T1F) which target "reactive movers" in crisis situations.

### Two Types of High-Converting Leads

| Mover Type | Firm Status | Motivation | Tiers |
|------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Reactive Movers** | Bleeding | "My firm is failing, I need to leave" | T1A, T1B, T1F |
| **Proactive Movers** ⭐ | **Stable** | "I've outgrown my firm, I want better" | **T1G (NEW)** |

### T1G: Growth Stage Advisor

**Definition:**
```sql
WHEN industry_tenure_months BETWEEN 60 AND 180  -- 5-15 years (mid-career)
     AND avg_account_size >= 250000              -- Established practice ($250K+)
     AND firm_net_change_12mo > -3               -- Stable firm (not bleeding)
THEN 'TIER_1G_GROWTH_STAGE_ADVISOR'
```

**Performance:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Conversion Rate | **7.20%** |
| Lift vs Baseline | **1.88x** |
| Sample Size | 125 leads |
| Overlap with T1A/T1B | **0** (mutually exclusive) |

**Why They Convert:**
1. **Strategic mindset** - Making thoughtful career decisions, not panic moves
2. **Established book** - Have real AUM ($250K+ avg account) to bring
3. **Growth-oriented** - Mid-career (5-15 years), still building
4. **Platform fit** - Need better technology/support to reach next level

### Updated Tier Hierarchy

| Priority | Tier | Definition | Conv Rate | Lift |
|----------|------|------------|-----------|------|
| 1 | **T1A** | CFP + Bleeding Firm | 9.80% | 2.57x |
| 2 | **T1G** ⭐ | **Growth Stage (NEW)** | **7.20%** | **1.88x** |
| 3 | **T1B** | Series 65 + Bleeding | 6.18% | 1.62x |
| 4 | T1F | HV Wealth + Bleeding | ~5% | ~1.3x |
| 5 | T1 | Prime Mover + Bleeding | ~4% | ~1.0x |

### Validation Results

| Check | Threshold | Result | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Lift | ≥ 1.5x | 1.88x | ✅ PASS |
| Sample Size | ≥ 50 | 125 | ✅ PASS |
| Overlap with T1A | 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| Overlap with T1B | 0 | 0 | ✅ PASS |
| 95% CI | Non-overlapping | ✅ | ✅ PASS |

### Why T1G Has Zero Overlap

T1G is **mutually exclusive** with existing tiers because of firm stability requirements:

- **T1A/T1B/T1F:** Require `firm_net_change_12mo <= -3` (bleeding)
- **T1G:** Requires `firm_net_change_12mo > -3` (stable)

A firm cannot be both bleeding AND stable simultaneously.

### V3.3.2 Hypothesis Testing Summary

**Individual Signals (All Failed):**

| Signal | Expected | Actual | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Low Ownership (<5%) | >1.5x | 0.64x | ❌ INVERTED |
| HNW Focus ($500K+ avg) | >1.5x | 0.54x | ❌ INVERTED |
| SMA Usage | >1.5x | N/A | ❌ Data issue |
| Portable Custodian | >1.5x | 0.88x | ❌ Not significant |

**Combination Analysis (Success):**

| Combination | Conv Rate | Lift | Result |
|-------------|-----------|------|--------|
| **Established + Stable + Mid-Career** | **7.20%** | **1.88x** | ✅ **T1G** |
| Growth Focus + Bleeding + Senior | 5.79% | 1.52x | ⚠️ Alternative |

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
```
v3/sql/phase_4_v3_tiered_scoring.sql          # T1G tier logic + avg_account_size CTE
pipeline/sql/January_2026_Lead_List_V3_V4_Hybrid.sql  # T1G in lead list
v3/models/model_registry_v3.json              # Updated to V3.3.2
README.md                                      # This section
v3/VERSION_3_MODEL_REPORT.md                  # Analysis documentation
```

**New Feature Added:**
```sql
-- avg_account_size = TOTAL_AUM / TOTAL_ACCOUNTS
-- Identifies "established practice" - advisors with meaningful client base
avg_account_size >= 250000  -- $250K+ average account
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Two types of high-converting leads exist:**
   - Reactive (bleeding firm, crisis-driven)
   - Proactive (stable firm, growth-driven)

2. **"Portable book" signals don't work individually:**
   - Ownership, HNW focus, SMA usage all failed or inverted
   - The COMBINATION matters, not individual signals

3. **Counter-intuitive findings:**
   - HNW advisors convert WORSE (too established, not looking to move)
   - Retail advisors convert BETTER (still growing, open to change)

4. **CFP detection was using wrong field:**
   - Was: `REP_LICENSES LIKE '%CFP%'` (WRONG - CFP is not a license)
   - Fixed: `CONTACT_BIO LIKE '%CFP%' OR TITLE_NAME LIKE '%CFP%'`

### Expected Impact

| Metric | Before V3.3.2 | After V3.3.2 | Change |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Priority Tiers | T1A, T1B, T1F | T1A, T1B, T1F, **T1G** | +1 tier |
| High-Converting Leads | ~310 | ~435 | **+125 leads** |
| New Segment | - | Proactive movers | ✅ Captured |

### Future Opportunities

**T1H Super-Tier (Monitor for V4):**
- Definition: Certification (CFP/Series 65) + T1G criteria
- Performance: 8.57% conversion (2.24x lift)
- Current sample: 35 leads (too small)
- Action: Monitor - implement if sample grows to 50+
