# V3.3.2 Portable Book Hypothesis Validation Report

**Date:** December 31, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** Historical leads from v4_target_variable  
**Baseline Conversion Rate:** 3.82%  
**Validation Criteria:** Lift >= 1.5x with sample >= 50 leads

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Validated Hypotheses (Lift >= 1.5x, Sample >= 50)
**NONE** - No individual hypotheses met the 1.5x lift threshold with sufficient sample size.

### Key Findings

1. **Ownership Hypothesis: INVALIDATED (INVERTED)**
   - **Finding:** High ownership (50%+) converts at 1.05x baseline (3.99%)
   - **No ownership converts at 0.64x baseline (2.43%)**
   - **Conclusion:** Confirms V3.3.1 Rainmaker finding - owners are LESS likely to convert
   - **Action:** DO NOT IMPLEMENT - would exclude the wrong segment

2. **Average Account Size Hypothesis: INVALIDATED**
   - **Finding:** Retail clients (<$100K avg) convert BEST at 1.10x (4.21%)
   - **Ultra-HNW ($5M+ avg) converts WORST at 0.54x (2.05%)**
   - **Conclusion:** Hypothesis completely inverted - mass market advisors convert better
   - **Action:** DO NOT IMPLEMENT

3. **SMA/Investment Style Hypothesis: INVALIDATED**
   - **Finding:** All investment styles convert at ~0.66x baseline
   - **SMA usage shows no differentiation**
   - **Conclusion:** Investment style does not predict portability
   - **Action:** DO NOT IMPLEMENT

4. **Custodian Hypothesis: PARTIALLY VALIDATED (Weak Signal)**
   - **Finding:** Portable custodians convert at 0.88x baseline (3.36%)
   - **Wirehouses convert at 0.18-0.36x baseline (strong exclusion signal)**
   - **Conclusion:** Portable custodians are NOT a positive signal, but wirehouses are strong negative
   - **Action:** DO NOT ADD as positive signal (already excluded in V3.3.1)

### Composite Portability Score
- **5 signals:** 1.15x lift (4.38% conversion) - **BEST PERFORMING**
- **4 signals:** 0.94x lift (3.58% conversion)
- **3 signals:** 0.92x lift (3.50% conversion)

**Key Insight:** Combining multiple weak signals creates a stronger composite signal, but still below 1.5x threshold.

### Recommendations for V3.3.2

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT any of the 4 new hypotheses individually.** All show lift < 1.5x or are inverted.

**CONSIDER:** Composite portability score (5+ signals) as a V4 feature for deprioritization, not V3 exclusion.

## 2. DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS

### 2.1 Ownership Percentage Distribution

| Ownership Value | Contact Count | % of Total |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| No Ownership | 262,018 | 91.71% |
| 75% or more | 8,890 | 3.11% |
| less than 5% | 4,384 | 1.53% |
| 50% but less than 75% | 2,545 | 0.89% |
| 25% but less than 50% | 1,799 | 0.63% |
| 10% but less than 25% | 1,483 | 0.52% |

**Key Finding:** 91.71% of advisors have "No Ownership" - this is the dominant category.

### 2.2 Account Size Data Coverage

| Metric | Count | Coverage % |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total Firms | 45,233 | 100% |
| Has AUM | 28,231 | 62.41% |
| Has Accounts | 28,231 | 62.41% |
| Has Both | 28,231 | 62.41% |

**Coverage:** 62.41% of firms have both AUM and account count data needed for average account size calculation.

### 2.3 Investment Types Distribution

**Finding:** INVESTMENTS_UTILIZED field appears to be mostly NULL or empty. All firms grouped into "No SMAs, No Direct Securities, No Mutual Funds, No ETFs" category.

**Data Quality Issue:** This field may not be properly populated, making SMA analysis unreliable.

### 2.4 Custodian Names (Top 30)

**Critical Discovery:** Custodian data is stored as **JSON arrays**, not plain strings!

| Custodian Name | Firm Count | % of Total |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| `["CHARLES SCHWAB & CO., INC."]` | 7,903 | 39.69% |
| `["INTERACTIVE BROKERS LLC"]` | 789 | 3.96% |
| `["FIDELITY BROKERAGE SERVICES LLC"]` | 756 | 3.80% |
| `["ALTRUIST FINANCIAL LLC"]` | 556 | 2.79% |
| `["CHARLES SCHWAB & CO., INC.", "FIDELITY BROKERAGE SERVICES LLC"]` | 540 | 2.71% |
| `["NATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES LLC"]` | 469 | 2.36% |
| `["LPL FINANCIAL LLC"]` | 334 | 1.68% |
| `["PERSHING LLC"]` | 245 | 1.23% |

**Why V3.3.1 Had 0 Matches:** The LIKE pattern matching works on JSON arrays! We need to search within the JSON structure.

### 2.5 Portable Custodian Pattern Search

| Pattern | Firm Count |
|---------|------------|
| Schwab Match | 11,958 |
| Other/No Match | 4,671 |
| Fidelity Match | 1,246 |
| National Match | 734 |
| Pershing Match | 578 |
| LPL Match | 387 |
| Raymond James Match | 241 |
| TD Ameritrade Match | 98 |
| Charles Match | 1 |

**Key Finding:** Pattern matching DOES work on JSON arrays! We found 11,958 Schwab matches, 1,246 Fidelity matches, and 578 Pershing matches.

**V3.3.1 Issue Resolved:** The custodian data is accessible, but conversion rates show portable custodians are NOT a positive signal (0.88x lift).

## 3. HYPOTHESIS RESULTS TABLE

| Hypothesis | Best Bucket | Conv Rate | Lift | Sample Size | Recommendation | Reason |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **1. Low Ownership** | High Ownership (50%+) | 3.99% | **1.05x** | 1,578 | ❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** | Inverted - high ownership converts better |
| **2. Average Account Size (HNW)** | Retail (<$100K avg) | 4.21% | **1.10x** | 428 | ❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** | Completely inverted - retail converts best |
| **3. SMA/Investment Style** | All buckets | ~2.52% | **0.66x** | 29,947 | ❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** | No differentiation, all below baseline |
| **4. Portable Custodian** | Portable Custodian | 3.36% | **0.88x** | 11,861 | ❌ **DO NOT IMPLEMENT** | Below baseline, not a positive signal |
| **Composite Score (5 signals)** | 5+ Signals | 4.38% | **1.15x** | 1,028 | ⚠️ **CONSIDER FOR V4** | Best performing but still < 1.5x threshold |

### Statistical Significance Notes

- **High Ownership (50%+):** 3.99% conversion, CI: 3.09% - 5.27% (overlaps with baseline 3.82%)
- **Retail Account Size:** 4.21% conversion, CI: 2.31% - 6.11% (overlaps with baseline)
- **Composite 5 Signals:** 4.38% conversion, CI: 3.18% - 5.58% (overlaps with baseline)

**None of the signals show statistically significant lift above baseline** (95% CI overlaps).

## 4. INTERACTION EFFECTS

### 4.1 Low Ownership + High Discretionary

| Combination | Leads | Conversions | Conv Rate | Lift |
|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Has Ownership + Low Discretionary | 242 | 9 | 3.72% | 0.97x |
| Has Ownership + Moderate/Unknown | 470 | 17 | 3.62% | 0.95x |
| Has Ownership + High Discretionary | 2,107 | 70 | 3.32% | 0.87x |
| Low Ownership + High Discretionary | 12,378 | 396 | 3.20% | 0.84x |
| Low Ownership + Moderate/Unknown | 8,781 | 179 | 2.04% | 0.53x |
| Low Ownership + Low Discretionary | 5,974 | 84 | 1.41% | 0.37x |

**Finding:** The combination does NOT amplify - actually performs worse than individual signals.

### 4.2 Low Ownership + HNW Focus

| Combination | Leads | Conversions | Conv Rate | Lift |
|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Has Ownership + Unknown | 341 | 13 | 3.81% | 1.00x |
| Has Ownership + Mass Market | 1,724 | 59 | 3.42% | 0.90x |
| Has Ownership + HNW Focus | 754 | 24 | 3.18% | 0.83x |
| Low Ownership + Unknown | 3,575 | 104 | 2.91% | 0.76x |
| Low Ownership + HNW Focus | 5,318 | 129 | 2.43% | 0.64x |
| Low Ownership + Mass Market | 18,240 | 426 | 2.34% | 0.61x |

**Finding:** Again, combinations perform WORSE than individual signals. HNW + Low Ownership = 0.64x (worst performing).

### 4.3 Ultimate Portability Score

| Portability Tier | Score | Leads | Conversions | Conv Rate | Lift |
|-----------------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
| 4+ Signals (Ultra-Portable) | 5 | 1,028 | 45 | **4.38%** | **1.15x** |
| 4+ Signals (Ultra-Portable) | 4 | 2,988 | 107 | 3.58% | 0.94x |
| 3 Signals (Highly Portable) | 3 | 4,491 | 157 | 3.50% | 0.92x |
| 2 Signals (Moderately Portable) | 2 | 10,167 | 239 | 2.35% | 0.62x |
| 1 Signal (Slightly Portable) | 1 | 11,021 | 199 | 1.81% | 0.47x |
| 0 Signals (Low Portability) | 0 | 257 | 8 | 3.11% | 0.81x |

**Key Finding:** 
- **5 signals = 1.15x lift** (best performing segment)
- **But still below 1.5x threshold** for implementation
- **Paradox:** 0 signals converts better (0.81x) than 1 signal (0.47x)

**Recommendation:** Consider composite score as V4 feature for deprioritization (bottom 20% filter), not as V3 positive signal.

---

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### 5.1 Signals to NOT Implement

| Signal | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Low Ownership | **INVERTED** - High ownership converts better (1.05x vs 0.64x) |
| Average Account Size (HNW) | **INVERTED** - Retail converts best (1.10x vs 0.54x for Ultra-HNW) |
| SMA/Investment Style | **NO DIFFERENTIATION** - All buckets at 0.66x baseline |
| Portable Custodian | **BELOW BASELINE** - 0.88x lift, not a positive signal |

### 5.2 Potential V4 Feature (Not V3)

**Composite Portability Score (5+ signals)**
- **Conversion Rate:** 4.38% (1.15x baseline)
- **Sample Size:** 1,028 leads
- **Use Case:** V4 deprioritization feature (flag bottom 20% with 0-1 signals)
- **NOT Recommended for V3:** Still below 1.5x threshold, would add complexity

### 5.3 Data Quality Improvements Needed

1. **INVESTMENTS_UTILIZED Field:** Appears empty/NULL for most firms - investigate data source
2. **Custodian JSON Parsing:** Consider parsing JSON arrays properly for more accurate matching
3. **Ownership Data:** 91.71% are "No Ownership" - may need to investigate if this is accurate or a data quality issue

### 5.4 Key Learnings

1. **Hypothesis Inversion:** Two hypotheses (Ownership, Account Size) showed the OPPOSITE of expected results
2. **Composite Signals:** Weak individual signals can combine to create stronger composite signals (1.15x)
3. **Data Quality Matters:** INVESTMENTS_UTILIZED field appears to have data quality issues
4. **Custodian Discovery:** Found that custodian data is JSON arrays, not strings - explains V3.3.1 issue

## 7. FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For V3.3.2 Implementation

**DO NOT IMPLEMENT any of the 4 new hypotheses.** All fail to meet the 1.5x lift threshold or are inverted.

### For Future Analysis

1. **Investigate INVESTMENTS_UTILIZED data quality** - Field appears empty for all firms
2. **Consider composite portability score for V4** - 5+ signals show 1.15x lift (still below threshold but best performing)
3. **Validate ownership data accuracy** - 91.71% "No Ownership" seems high, may be data quality issue
4. **Wirehouse exclusion validation** - Wirehouses show 0.09-0.23x lift, confirms existing exclusion strategy

### Key Insight

**These signals work better as EXCLUSION criteria (identifying what NOT to target) than INCLUSION criteria (identifying what TO target).** This aligns with V3.3.1 findings.
