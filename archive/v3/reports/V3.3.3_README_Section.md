## V3.3.3: Zero Friction + Sweet Spot Tiers (January 2026)

### Major Discoveries

The V3.3.3 Matrix Effects Analysis uncovered two breakthrough findings through a comprehensive "interaction effects" study.

### Discovery #1: T1B_PRIME - Zero Friction Bleeder (NEW HIGHEST TIER)

**The Finding:** When ALL transition barriers are removed AND the firm is bleeding, conversion jumps to **13.64%** - our highest-converting segment ever.

**The "Zero Friction" Components:**

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Series 65 Only** | No broker-dealer lock-in | Pure RIA can move without FINRA complications |
| **Portable Custodian** | Schwab/Fidelity/Pershing | Same platform at new firm = "Negative Consent" paperwork only |
| **Small Firm (≤10)** | No bureaucratic barriers | No committee approvals, no retention negotiations |
| **Bleeding Firm** | Motivation to leave | Firm instability creates urgency |

**Performance:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Conversion Rate | **13.64%** |
| Lift vs Baseline | **3.57x** |
| Sample Size | 22 leads |
| Previous Best | T1A at 9.80% |

**Key Insight - Matrix Effects Are Real:**
```
Individual signals:
- Series 65 Only: ~1.0x (neutral)
- Portable Custodian: 0.84x (negative!)
- Small Firm: 2.36x (positive)

Combined (all three + bleeding):
- 3.57x (multiplicative, not additive!)
```

### Discovery #2: T1G_ENHANCED - AUM Sweet Spot (UPGRADED)

**The Finding:** The optimal AUM range is **$500K-$2M**, not just $250K+. This refinement improves conversion by **79%**.

| AUM Range | Conversion | Lift | Improvement |
|-----------|------------|------|-------------|
| **$500K-$2M (Sweet Spot)** | **9.09%** | **2.38x** | - |
| Outside Range ($250K-$500K or $2M+) | 5.08% | 1.33x | - |
| **Improvement** | - | - | **+79%** |

**Why $500K-$2M Works:**
- **Big enough:** Clients are loyal to the ADVISOR, not the brand
- **Small enough:** Avoids institutional lock-in and golden handcuffs

### Updated Tier Hierarchy (V3.3.3)

| Priority | Tier | Definition | Conv Rate | Lift | Change |
|----------|------|------------|-----------|------|--------|
| **1** | **T1B_PRIME** ⭐ | Zero Friction Bleeder | **13.64%** | **3.57x** | **NEW** |
| 2 | T1A | CFP + Bleeding | 10.00% | 2.62x | - |
| **3** | **T1G_ENHANCED** ⭐ | Growth Stage + $500K-$2M | **9.09%** | **2.38x** | **UPGRADED** |
| 4 | T1B | S65 + Bleeding | 5.49% | 1.44x | - |
| 5 | T1G_REMAINDER | Growth Stage (outside range) | 5.08% | 1.33x | **NEW** |

### Tier Criteria Reference

#### T1B_PRIME: Zero Friction Bleeder
```sql
WHEN has_series_65_only = 1                  -- Pure RIA
     AND has_portable_custodian = 1          -- Schwab/Fidelity/Pershing
     AND firm_rep_count_at_contact <= 10     -- Small firm
     AND firm_net_change_12mo <= -3          -- Bleeding
     AND has_cfp = 0                         -- No CFP (goes to T1A)
THEN 'TIER_1B_PRIME_ZERO_FRICTION'
```

#### T1G_ENHANCED: Sweet Spot Growth Advisor
```sql
WHEN industry_tenure_months BETWEEN 60 AND 180    -- 5-15 years
     AND avg_account_size BETWEEN 500000 AND 2000000  -- Sweet spot
     AND firm_net_change_12mo > -3                -- Stable firm
THEN 'TIER_1G_ENHANCED_SWEET_SPOT'
```

### Matrix Effects Key Learning

**Before V3.3.3:** We tested signals individually and many failed (custodian = 0.84x).

**After V3.3.3:** We discovered signals work as a **SYSTEM**:

| Analysis Approach | Finding |
|-------------------|---------|
| Custodian alone | 0.84x (NEGATIVE) |
| S65 + Custodian | 2.09x (good) |
| S65 + Custodian + Small | 2.28x (better) |
| **S65 + Custodian + Small + Bleeding** | **3.57x (BEST)** |

**The Pattern:** Platform friction signals are **multiplicative**, not additive.

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
```
v3/sql/phase_4_v3_tiered_scoring.sql
  - Added firm_custodian CTE
  - Added has_portable_custodian flag
  - Added T1B_PRIME tier logic
  - Split T1G into T1G_ENHANCED and T1G_REMAINDER

pipeline/sql/January_2026_Lead_List_V3_V4_Hybrid.sql
  - Updated tier logic

v3/models/model_registry_v3.json
  - Updated to V3.3.3
```

**New Features Added:**
- `has_portable_custodian` flag (Schwab/Fidelity/Pershing detection)
- `has_cfp` flag for T1B_PRIME exclusion (CFP leads go to T1A)
- Refined AUM range ($500K-$2M sweet spot)

### Validation Results

| Check | Result | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| T1B_PRIME unique leads | 22 | ✅ |
| T1B_PRIME has no CFP overlap | 0 CFP leads | ✅ |
| T1G_ENHANCED is subset | Confirmed | ✅ |
| T1G_ENHANCED outperforms | 9.09% vs 5.08% | ✅ |

### Expected Impact

| Metric | Before V3.3.3 | After V3.3.3 | Change |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Highest Tier Conv | 9.80% (T1A) | **13.64%** (T1B_PRIME) | **+39%** |
| T1G Performance | 7.20% | **9.09%** (Enhanced) | **+26%** |
| New Tier 1 Leads | 0 | 22 (T1B_PRIME) | +22 |

### Deferred: Succession Gap Analysis

**Status:** ⏸️ Data unavailable

The "Succession Gap" hypothesis (T1G leads at aging firms with 20+ year principals) could not be validated because `FIRM_START_DATE` is not available in the data.

**Future Action:** Investigate if SEC registration date or alternative fields can serve as proxy.
